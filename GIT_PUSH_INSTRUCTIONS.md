   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete dump truck logistics management system with activity tracking and undo functionality"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Download and Push from Local Machine
1. Download your entire Replit project
2. On your local machine, navigate to the project folder
3. Run these commands:
   ```bash
   git init
   git remote add origin https://github.com/mxracer888/DirtMoversIO.git
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete dump truck logistics management system"
   git push -u origin main

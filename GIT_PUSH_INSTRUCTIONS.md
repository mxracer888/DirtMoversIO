# Manual Git Push Instructions

Your Dirt Movers application is complete and ready to be pushed to GitHub. Due to git lock files in the Replit environment, you'll need to push manually.

## Option 1: Use Replit's Git Integration
1. Open the Shell tab in Replit
2. Run these commands one by one:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete dump truck logistics management system with activity tracking and undo functionality"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Download and Push from Local Machine
1. Download your entire Replit project
2. On your local machine, navigate to the project folder
3. Initialize git if needed: `git init`
4. Add remote: `git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git`
5. Add files: `git add .`
6. Commit: `git commit -m "Complete dump truck logistics management system"`
7. Push: `git push -u origin main`
